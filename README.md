# BigMartIQ

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
BigMartIQ is a machine learning project that predicts the sales of products across different BigMart outlets using historical sales data. The model is trained on the `train.csv` dataset and built entirely on Google Colab.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack & Libraries
- **Python**
- **NumPy** â€“ Numerical computations
- **Pandas** â€“ Data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Preprocessing, train-test split, evaluation metrics
- **XGBoost** â€“ Regression model for prediction

## ðŸš€ Features
- Preprocessing and handling of missing values
- Encoding categorical variables with LabelEncoder
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations
- XGBRegressor model to predict sales
- Model evaluation using RÂ² Score and RMSE


## ðŸ“Š Model Workflow
1. Load `train.csv` dataset into Google Colab
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Perform EDA and visualize insights
4. Encode categorical features using LabelEncoder
5. Split dataset into training and test sets
6. Train XGBoost Regressor and evaluate performance

## âœ… Results
- Built a regression model to accurately predict BigMart sales.
- Visualizations provide insights into the effect of features like item type and outlet size on sales.
